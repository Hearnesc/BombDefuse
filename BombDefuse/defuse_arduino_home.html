    <info class="column"><colhead>What is Defuse the Ardiuno?<br /></colhead>
    This is a game designed to make learning fun and exciting within the class room or at home. All that is needed
    to play the game is a phone or computer, a small arduino kit.</info>
    <info2 class="column"><colhead>How to Play<br /></colhead>
    Each student or group of students is given an Arduino kit, which needs to be 'defused'. Click through the tabs that contain
    a puzzle. After solving each puzzle, a number 1 through 9 is obtained. Turn the dial to the number and press the button
    to lock in the answer. If the answer is correct, the green light will flash, and they can
    move onto the next puzzle. If the answer is wrong, they have failed to defuse the Arduino.</info2>
